      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a guitarist for approximately 10 years, so I&amp;rsquo;ve written a song or two over the past decade. I&amp;rsquo;ve also tried engaging in music production (with little luck), and still try to learn more about it everyday and improve my mixing and mastering abilities. I still have a lot more songs to finish, if I can ever get over my writer&amp;rsquo;s block and learn how to mix drums properly. A mix I&amp;rsquo;m particularly proud of is a song called Talk by my friends&#39; band called Paradox, which won multiple college competitions across the country while they were active.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a rock/metal guitarist for the past 9 or 10 years, mostly concentrating on Western music and its theory; I am by no means an expert, but I&amp;rsquo;m curious about music theory and like to learn its different applications/interpretations in various styles.
 I attended a Remember Shakti concert in 2012, which was my first real introduction to Indian classical musical elements. I know that it&amp;rsquo;s a fusion band, but I learnt the basic rhythmic elements during the concert thanks to my school&amp;rsquo;s guitar teacher, with whom I went to the concert (Maniche Farande, for anyone who&amp;rsquo;s interested in stalking him).</description>
