      <description>Volterra Equation Introduction The Volterra equation governs coupled population dynamics between two species under a predator-prey relationship in a given environment.
Consider $x$ as the number of rabbits, and $y$ as the number of foxes. This is expressed in the form of the following autonomous system of ordinary differential equations.
$$ \begin{aligned} \dot x &amp;amp; = \alpha x - \eta yx, &amp;amp; \alpha, \eta &amp;gt; 0 \\ \dot y &amp;amp; = -\beta y + \lambda xy, &amp;amp; \beta, \lambda &amp;gt; 0 \\ \end{aligned} $$</description>

AIAA Journal, 1986. Katz, Joseph and Plotkin, Allen. Low-Speed Aerodynamics - 2nd Edition. Cambridge University Press, 2001.  Viscous-Inviscid Panel Methods Boundary element methods express the solution of some PDE on a volume by reducing it to the specification on a surface. Panel methods in aerodynamics are special cases of such expressions, in which the governing equation is Laplace&amp;rsquo;s equation in a uniform flow in the case of a steady, inviscid, incompressible fluid.</description>

      <description>Optimisation problems are becoming a big meme, so let&amp;rsquo;s address some of the general ideas and how to compute them for discretised systems of equations.
Problem Description Let the vector $\mathbf p_i \in \mathbb R^n$ be the state variable at the $i$th iteration, and the function as a matrix $\mathbf R \in \mathbb R^m \times \mathbb R^n$ which needs to be solved.
$$ \mathbf R(\mathbf p) = \mathbf 0 $$</description>

      <description>This &amp;lsquo;notebook&amp;rsquo; consists of my run-through of Prof. Lorena Barba&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;12 steps to Navier-Stokes&amp;rdquo; course, because I admit I have a problem with fluids. The Navier-Stokes equations that will be solved in this notebook are the following in conservative form:
$$ \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \left(\rho V\right) = 0 $$
$$ \frac{\partial (\rho\vec V)}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \left(\rho ~\vec V \otimes \vec V + p\hat I \right) = \rho \vec g + \nabla \cdot \hat \tau + \vec f$$</description>

      <title>Academic Notes — Physics and Mathematics</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been studying some physics for a while and decided to write solution manuals for reference in case I forget the approach to a problem later. They&amp;rsquo;re lazily written, hence some solutions might be incomplete, incorrect or have illogical statements. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve compiled so far:

      <title>Variational Calculus — Geodesic Equation</title>
      <link>https://godot-bloggy.xyz/post/variational-calculus-geodesic-equation/</link>

      <description>Bernard F. Schutz&amp;rsquo;s A First Course in General Relativity provides a nice introduction to the difficult subject in my opinion. In Chapter 6, he mentions that one should derive the Euler-Lagrange equations to minimise the spacetime interval of a particle&amp;rsquo;s trajectory, obtaining the geodesic equation:
$$ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\lambda}\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}x^{\gamma}}{\mathrm{d}\lambda}\right) + \Gamma^{\gamma}_{~\alpha\beta}\frac{\mathrm{d}x^{\alpha}}{\mathrm{d}\lambda}\frac{\mathrm{d}x^{\beta}}{\mathrm{d}\lambda} = 0 $$
Note: At first I derived it from variational principles, but the Euler-Lagrange equations provide a faster route via means of a neat trick.</description>

      <title>Variational Calculus — Induced Drag Over a Wing</title>
      <link>https://godot-bloggy.xyz/post/induced-drag/</link>

      <description>While reading through John D. Anderson Jr.&amp;rsquo;s derivation of minimum induced drag, I thought of a cool application of the calculus of variations in one of the equations to deduce the required condition.
The equation that determines the downwash at a point is:
$$w(y_0) = -\frac{1}{4\pi }\int^{b/2}_{-b/2} \frac{(\mathrm{d}\Gamma/\mathrm{d}y)}{y_0 - y}\mathrm{d}y = \int^{b/2}_{-b/2} \mathcal{L}(\Gamma,\Gamma&#39;,y)~\mathrm{d}y$$
This effectively implies that the downwash can be expressed as a functional of $\Gamma$, i.e. $w\left[\Gamma(y)\right]$, and one can find the functional derivative to find the extremal point.</description>

      <description>During my second year of the International Baccalaureate: Diploma Programme, we were assigned the task of making a portfolio for a problem statement in Mathematics HL. While I don&amp;rsquo;t have the problem statement anymore, I&amp;rsquo;ll outline the major points of the task:
  Find the solutions to $z^n - 1 = 0,~ z \in \mathbb{C}$.
  Plot these solutions on the Argand plane.
  Draw a tree diagram starting from the trivial solution $z = 1$ to every other root.</description>
