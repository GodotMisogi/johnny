Viscous-Inviscid Panel Methods Boundary element methods express the solution of some PDE on a volume by reducing it to the specification on a surface. Panel methods in aerodynamics are special cases of such expressions, in which the governing equation is Laplace&amp;rsquo;s equation in a uniform flow in the case of a steady, inviscid, incompressible fluid.</description>

      <title>Meshing Techniques — Cambered Airfoil</title>

      <description>Meshing is a crucial process in obtaining accurate results for various simulations across different fields. In computational fluid dynamics, various meshing techniques are used in grid generation for 2D analyses of airfoils. Some nice run-throughs exist on YouTube, but they mostly deal with symmetric airfoils such as the beloved NACA 0012. I&amp;rsquo;ll attempt generating preliminary meshes over a cambered airfoil in this post and probably write a project once I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to perform flow analyses with accurate results.</description>

      <title>Variational Calculus — Induced Drag Over a Wing</title>
      <link>https://godot-bloggy.xyz/post/induced-drag/</link>

      <description>While reading through John D. Anderson Jr.&amp;rsquo;s derivation of minimum induced drag, I thought of a cool application of the calculus of variations in one of the equations to deduce the required condition.
The equation that determines the downwash at a point is:
$$w(y_0) = -\frac{1}{4\pi }\int^{b/2}_{-b/2} \frac{(\mathrm{d}\Gamma/\mathrm{d}y)}{y_0 - y}\mathrm{d}y = \int^{b/2}_{-b/2} \mathcal{L}(\Gamma,\Gamma&#39;,y)~\mathrm{d}y$$
This effectively implies that the downwash can be expressed as a functional of $\Gamma$, i.e. $w\left[\Gamma(y)\right]$, and one can find the functional derivative to find the extremal point.</description>
