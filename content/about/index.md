Hello! I'm Arjit Seth, a research assistant at the Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

My major interests, which inspired me to start this blog, are physics, mathematics, aerodynamics and music. I enjoy writing music, solving puzzles, figuring out odd time signatures in music, reading manga/watching anime, attempting amateur design and a lot more!

My current exploits which I'm probably going to blog about:

* Developing aircraft design analyses and optimisations.
* Programming physics and aerodynamics simulations in various languages.
* Learning various fields of mathematics, such as category theory, group theory, differential geometry, Stone's representation theorem, etc.
* Learning quantum mechanics, quantum field theory and general relativity.
* Developing music production skills for various genres.

<!-- A more comprehensive overview is available in my [curriculum vitae](ArjitSethCV.pdf). -->

The following [eXtended Design Structure Matrix](https://github.com/mdolab/pyXDSM) outlines my learning process as an optimisation framework.
