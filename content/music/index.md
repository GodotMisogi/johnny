I've been a guitarist for approximately 10 years, so I've written a song or two over the past decade. I've also tried engaging in music production (with little luck), and still try to learn more about it everyday and improve my mixing and mastering abilities. I still have a lot more songs to finish, if I can ever get over my writer's block and learn how to mix drums properly.
A mix I'm particularly proud of is a song called Talk by my friends' band called Paradox, which won multiple college competitions across the country while they were active.
Check out the stuff I've worked on through my SoundCloud!
