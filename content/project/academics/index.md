I've been studying some physics for a while and decided to write solution manuals for reference in case I forget the approach to a problem later. They're lazily written, hence some solutions might be incomplete, incorrect or have illogical statements. Here's what I've compiled so far:

* [Tom Lancaster et. al. - Quantum Field Theory for the Gifted Amateur](https://github.com/GodotMisogi/physics-notes/blob/master/Quantum%20Field%20Theory%20for%20the%20Gifted%20Amateur%20-%20T.%20Lancaster%20%26%20S.%20J.%20Blundell/Lancaster%20Solutions.pdf)
* [Bernard F. Schutz - A First Course in General Relativity](https://github.com/GodotMisogi/physics-notes/blob/master/A%20First%20Course%20in%20General%20Relativity%20-%20B.%20F.%20Schutz/Schutz%20Solutions.pdf)
* [Ramamurti Shankar - Principles of Quantum Mechanics](https://github.com/GodotMisogi/physics-notes/blob/master/Principles%20of%20Quantum%20Mechanics%20-%20R.%20Shankar/Shankar%20Solutions.pdf)
* [T. Padmanabhan - Gravitation: Foundations and Frontiers](https://github.com/GodotMisogi/physics-notes/blob/master/Gravitation%2C%20Foundations%20and%20Frontiers%20-%20T.%20Padmanabhan/Gravitation.pdf)

I've also attended some conferences on mathematics and written down some (very incomplete) notes from the talks, and studied some areas with `Vyn` from freenode's `##math`:

* [Hopf Algebras and Combinatorics Lecture Notes](https://github.com/GodotMisogi/math-notes/blob/master/Hopf%20Algebra%20and%20Combinatorics/Hopf%20Algebra%20and%20Combinatorics.pdf) (with `Vyn`)
* [Cycle Polynomial of Permutation Groups](https://github.com/GodotMisogi/math-notes/blob/master/Cycle%20Polynomial/Cycle%20Polynomial.pdf) (with `Vyn`)
* [Heaps and Applications by K. N. Raghavan](https://github.com/GodotMisogi/math-notes/blob/master/Heaps%20And%20Applications/Heaps%20and%20Applications%20-%20K.%20N.%20Raghavan.pdf)
